# IP Finder

This is a React + TypeScript project, utilizing TailwindCSS, Redux-toolkit, React-Router-Dom, Axios, React-Query, custom-hooks, & Vite.

I was on a tight schedule so I decided to go with TailwindCSS instead of *styled-components*, as I'm much faster with TailWindCSS because I regularly use it at work.
